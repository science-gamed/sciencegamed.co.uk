<p>Game development is a creative endeavour, so I wanted to talk about how I go about generating ideas when I work.
</p>

<p>I recently saw <a href="https://youtu.be/DMpdPrm6Ul4">this talk</a> by John Cleese in which he talks about the creative process and how he worked. He points out no-one really knows where their creative ideas come from, they just….happen, and it’s important to give yourself space to try and generate these ideas.</p>

<!-- break -->

<p>It’s good advice and anyone who’s tried to come up with ideas can testify how random the whole thing is - sometimes you get a flash of inspiration, and sometimes you get nothing but a dull whimper. But what makes the difference between the two?</p>

<p>I believe it’s about finding what setup works for you and adapting. Over time I’ve tried several things and now have found my favourite ways to try and settle into the ‘zone’ when I’m generating ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>I work using the Pareto principle. You work for a set period of time, and then take a break. It’s pretty basic, but it helps organize your sessions into a manageable chunks of time</li>

<li>Turn emails, notifications, your phone, EVERYTHING (except the lights and the coffee machine!) off. The whole point of these sessions is you shouldn’t be interrupted, because once you’re deep in thought it takes work to get back to the same spot if you’re suddenly pulled out. It also helps to shut yourself off in a private room if you can, or let those people who you live with that they shouldn’t disturb you</li>

<li>I prefer to work with music on. I used to choose my own music which actually was time consuming (as I had to take time to choose) and often my brain would get distracted because it would be humming along to music it knew and liked</li>

<li>I've started using focus@will.com, a site that plays music scientifically proven to not be distracting. It sounds a bit strange, but having used them for months now I can say it’s made starting a work session much quicker – just log in to the website, and away you go</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s also important you don’t get frustrated if a session turns out to be fruitless. We don’t know where creativity comes from and everyone has those sessions where nothing works and you feel like you haven’t made progress. Getting frustrated won’t help and will only make it harder to get back into a good, creative frame of mind. I find just accepting that sometimes these things happen makes me less stressed and eager again to jump into the next session.</p>

<p>These points aren’t meant to be a concrete set of guidelines - in fact I’m certain they won’t work for everyone, because everyone works in different ways. But I hope sharing what’s worked for me might help you work out your ideal conditions.</p>

<p>Happy thinking!</p>
