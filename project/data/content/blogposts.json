Luckily Mother Nature isn’t a patent troll, so Romero can keep his cash. Here's a look at a few of the behaviour-altering parasites from nature that you (probably) have never heard of.\n\n## Toxoplasma gondii\n\n### Unlucky victims – Rodents\n\nA parasite that can only sexually reproduce in cats, when *T.gondii* infects a rodent (which can be done through eating infected cat faeces or anything that has touched it), it needs to find a way to get back into a cat.  Cue a little behavioural change in the rodent. [Experiments have shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007336) that infected rodents are less averse to cat odours than normal, thereby increasing their chance of getting caught by a cat. Good for *T.gondii*, bad for mousey.\n\nOther warm-blooded mammals can be infected by ingesting infected substances, **including humans**. Although rodents are the only species that seems to undergo a severe behavioural change, it is thought that *T.gondii* has been [responsible for schizophrenia and depression in humans.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/4/1)\n\n<figure>\n\t<img alt='Thousands of *T.gondii* parasites in a cyst inside mouse brain tissue' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Toxoplasma_gondii_tissue_cyst_in_mouse_brain.jpg/640px-Toxoplasma_gondii_tissue_cyst_in_mouse_brain.jpg'>\n\t<figcaption>Thousands of *T.gondii* parasites (stained red) in a cyst inside mouse brain tissue. Image: [Wikimedia Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Toxoplasma_gondii_tissue_cyst_in_mouse_brain.jpg)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Euhaplorchis californiensis\n\n### Unlucky victims - Killifish\n\nKnown as a ‘brain-encysting trematode’, this parasite’s lifecycle is: shorebird- hornsnail- killifish. After sexually reproducing and finishing its lifecycle in a shorebird, its eggs are released in the bird’s droppings. Hornsnails, which consume the droppings (as they graze) act as the first intermediary host.\n\nThe consumed parasites inhibit the unlucky snail’s sex drive by castrating it (yes, that’s not a typo). They then replicate (asexually) inside the snail. As the parasitic larvae mature, they break out of the snail and swim freely in the water, until they find their 2nd intermediary host- the killifish.\n\nOnce in the killifish, the parasites alter the fish’s behaviour to make it 30 times more likely to be caught by a bird and eaten, thus completing the lifecyle of the parasite ([read more](http://fuschmu.wordpress.com/tag/euhaplorchis-californiensis/) on this gruesome lifecyle or [watch a documentary that could be a horror film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5UzztCns-Y)). \n\nInterestingly, the mechanism is similar to the *T.gondii* parasite- it supresses a common stress response in the fish and also makes them visit the water surface more often, increasing their chances of getting caught by shorebirds.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img alt='The killifish is a host for *Euhaplorchis californiensis*' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Fundulopanchax_gardneri.png/640px-Fundulopanchax_gardneri.png'>\n\t<figcaption>‘I have a sudden urge to get myself noticed.’ Image: [Wikimedia Commons/Violaine2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fundulopanchax_gardneri.png)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Dicrocoelium dendriticum\n### Unlucky victims - Ants\n\nYes, it’s the poor ant again (they are also a [host of the parasitic fungus *Cordyceps* mentioned earlier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBAL8)), and another Trematode, or parasite worm, or “fluke” as they’re sometimes called.\n\nIn this case, the ant is the 2nd intermediary host after a snail, with the primary host being cattle or livestock. Ants use snail trails as a source of moisture, and in doing so can ingest a parasite cyst, full of juvenile flukes….and it then becomes infected.\n\nMost of the parasites stay in the ant’s main body cavity (the haemocoel) whilst they mature. However some travel to a cluster of nerve cells near the ant’s esophagus. There they manipulate the ant. How? At dusk, as the air cools and sun retreats, the infected ant will leave its colony, go find a tall grass stem, clamp its mandibles and stay there until dawn. At dawn the ant regains control and goes about its daily business as usual (to stay there in the sun would be death for both ant and parasite). When night falls, it repeats this morbid behaviour. The reason? At the top of a grass stem, it is more likely to be eaten by grazing cattle, and the parasite then completes its lifecycle.\n\nThe unlucky news for us is that humans can also get infected, through eating undercooked infected animal liver. This leads to a ‘pseudoparasite’ infection, because it is temporary- the parasites will survive in the intestine but be released from the body by defecation. For a more serious infection, you’d need to eat the two intermediary hosts- snails or ants (seriously, [it can happen](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660816/)- drinking water with an ant in it or eating raw salad or vegetables containing infected ants).\n\n<figure>\n\t<img alt='‘Something tells me I should just hang here for awhile’' src='http://en.citizendium.org/images/3/39/800px-Ant_on_leaf.jpg'>\n\t<figcaption>‘Something tells me I should just hang here for awhile’ Image: [Citizendium](http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/dicrocoelium_dendriticum)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAnd so ends our trip amongst a few lesser known parasites that alter behaviour. If we look back at our ‘zombie-checklist’ from earlier:\n\n1.\tAn infection is the causative agent- check, in these cases a lovely parasite.\n2.\tBehaviour altering? Yep. \n3.\tBiting spreads the infection. Ok so not really, but hey - two out of three ain’t bad (as Meatloaf sang).\n\nOk, so there are some differences. For one, in no instance are any hosts ‘dead’ but still functioning- they’re always alive. Also none of them cause their hosts to start eating their friends- but once you move past that you’ll see what you thought were the realms of fantasy are actually grounded firmly in reality. And despite two of the three being known to infect humans, as we are not standard hosts for these parasites the effect they have (if any) is wildly different to what they do during their natural lifecycle, so you shouldn't be too worried about seeing a human zombie shuffle past any time soon.\n\nThere are probably some of you who have been shouting and screaming throughout this article, “What about Rabies!?”. Well, you’d be right. The rabies virus does present itself as a very likely [source for zombies and, perhaps surprisingly, vampires, in popular culture.](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/18/4201878/sick-idea-how-rabies-spawned-vampires-and-zombies) \n\nThe fact is, it’s quite surprising that *The Last of Us* is really the first big game to utilise parts of nature like this, because when you look at it, there really are some weird, funky and downright gruesome things that happen in the natural world- all, oddly enough, in the name of survival - just not the host’s survival.",

Think about the rules for a second- how long do you think it took them to perfect the balance of starting positions and army sizes in Risk? Or the price of properties in Monopoly? Or even just the amount of money each player got for passing 'Go'? I hope you see how complex these seemingly simple rules are during the design process.\n\nWe’re having similar discussions/tribulations with Monkey Panic – which is why it’s kind of sad to see articles like [this.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art) saying that video games aren’t art. \n\nIt all really comes down to your definition of what ‘art’ is- something that allows personal interpretation? Something which creates emotions in people? Something that is created out of nothing? Probably a combination of all three.\n\nOf course if you take the official definition of art [here.](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art) (probably better than my version. In fact, almost definitely better), you can understand why we’d consider game design art. The amount of creativity you have to have in order to create rules that work out of nothing- in fact it’s not dissimilar to writing a novel (although this is pure speculation from someone who reads as I have never written a novel). We are creating a world from scratch, and also creating its rules and boundaries. I've read Wuthering Heights- there were lots of rules and boundaries there. So it must be similar.\n\nYes, there are limitations we have to impose on the game in order to make it work, but you could argue that those limitations are in every work of art. A picture has an end, a boundary, and therefore can only contain a limited amount of stuff for a viewer to process. Plays and movies have an end, and again are limited (in their case by their running time). Looking at these more ‘traditional’ art forms and the boundaries they have, the limitations of video games and their ‘rules’ are not as, well, limiting to making video games ‘art’.\n\nWhat do you think? Let us [know](mailto:hello@sciencegamed.co.uk). We’re always interested in healthy debate.\n\nIn the meantime- we’ll continue to think of ourselves as _avant-garde_ artists because what we’re trying is innovative. And also _avant-garde_ means ‘vanguard’ in French, and vanguards are cool (in fact, as it’s the end of the blog post, let’s go completely off-topic: vanguards were the hardest class to master in Mass Effect 1/2/3.

Probably a combination of all three.</p>\n\n<p>Of course if you take the official definition of art <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art\">here.</a> (probably better than my version. In fact, almost definitely better), you can understand why we’d consider game design art. The amount of creativity you have to have in order to create rules that work out of nothing- in fact it’s not dissimilar to writing a novel (although this is pure speculation from someone who reads as I have never written a novel). We are creating a world from scratch, and also creating its rules and boundaries. I've read Wuthering Heights- there were lots of rules and boundaries there. So it must be similar.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there are limitations we have to impose on the game in order to make it work, but you could argue that those limitations are in every work of art. A picture has an end, a boundary, and therefore can only contain a limited amount of stuff for a viewer to process. Plays and movies have an end, and again are limited (in their case by their running time). Looking at these more ‘traditional’ art forms and the boundaries they have, the limitations of video games and their ‘rules’ are not as, well, limiting to making video games ‘art’.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think? Let us <a href=\"mailto:hello@sciencegamed.co.uk\">know</a>. We’re always interested in healthy debate.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime- we’ll continue to think of ourselves as <em>avant-garde</em> artists because what we’re trying is innovative. And also <em>avant-garde</em> means ‘vanguard’ in French, and vanguards are cool (in fact, as it’s the end of the blog post, let’s go completely off-topic: vanguards were the hardest class to master in Mass Effect 1/2/3. Discuss.).</p>"

This ranges from the more classic studies, [like the effect of games on people](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/11/23/natures-neuroscientific-review-of-games/), using video game technology to [support and augment scientific study](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057990) to actually creating video games that are scientific experiments ([Foldit](http://fold.it/portal/) is a good example).\n\nThinking about this, it becomes apparent that there are actually some neat parallels between science and video games. Below are a few that sprang to mind-\n\n###1. Each explores a world through trial and error\n\nThat latest game that you played- you died or failed a few times, right? I bet you learnt the best strategies for dealing with enemies, or the best power-ups for certain situations- so trial and error. All games have it. Some choose to make you rely on it more than others, depending on how comprehensive their tutorials are.\n\nWell, science works like this too. Each scientific experiment is a question, which in turn involves a series of trials to provide evidence as to whether this question is true or not. Either way this provides us (humanity) with new knowledge- we know something happens in this way, or actually we find out that it doesn’t happen this way, which leaves possibilities open as to how it does actually happen.  It’s a longer process, sure, but still very similar to the gamer working out the rules/laws of the game world they’re in.\n\n###2. Science and video games have talented communities of amateurs who can sometimes help advance the field\n\nAmateur astronomers have [discovered planets](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/10020144/Schoolchildren-discover-new-comet-on-school-trip.html). Amateur/Indie games developers have delivered titles that have [changed the gaming landscape](http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/09/10-bastion-2011-we-wanted.html?p=2). \n\n(There might be a bit of bite back over the use of the term ‘Indie’ alongside ‘amateur’- it’s worth noting that some Indies are in fact experienced developers who have decided to go it alone. But I hope you see the principle- those who aren’t directly employed by companies in the field can still make a difference).\n\n###3. They are investments\n\nIn video games, you usually take a tentative first few steps when you start the game, and are often overwhelmed with the new world you're in, its sounds, the game story. You solider on in the face of adversity and without truly knowing whether you’ll enjoy the whole experience, but if you stick with it you often find yourself a master at the end of the game. You’re easily able to beat/overcome the obstacles that at the start felt impassable. The best games give you that sense of growth. \n\nScience is very similar. Scientific experiments start out as questions, and then experiments are devised to answer and test those questions. Who knows what will come of it? It may be that we know a bit more about the world, or it may be a vaccine that [saves millions of lives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#Development). Investment in scientific research is often cited as [the best investment option](http://www.sciencecoalition.org/showContent.cfm?id=798&section=briefingroom&pageName=Legislative%20Issues) for government cash.\n\n###4. Both science and video games base their origins in universities\n\nAlthough the principles of science- exploration, discovery, enlightenment- have been around for as long as mankind, the birth of modern, organised science (in the West) can arguably be traced to universities, which were created as centres of learning, and consequently became where scholars and academics practised and discussed science. Similarly, video games started out in the 1950s as being university projects. Early video games utilised the mainframe computers that were only found at universities, before giving birth to the video game consoles in the 1970s which ultimately found their way into people’s homes.\n\nSo next time you’re at a party being distracted by the loud fighting couple, try and look for the quieter couple standing to one side. They may not be making a scene and drawing attention, but who knows, they may have a long, rich and interesting history to share, if you ask. \n\n\n*Comments, thoughts, feedback? Great!
