<h1>About us</h1>

We love science. We also love games. And one day, we realised that the two are connected &ndash; both are about *understanding systems*. The best games invite you into their world and say 'these are the rules: what can you discover?'

Our mission is to create games that promote scientific literacy &ndash; not by beating people over the head with it, but by creating worlds that model scientific phenomena and inviting players to discover their own love of science.
