<h1>About us</h1>

<p>We love science. We also love games. And one day, we realised that the two are connected. The best games invite you into their world and say 'these are the rules: what can you discover?' We want to invite you into our games, so you can discover the natural world.</p>

<p><em>Science: Gamed</em> was founded with one goal in mind: to inspire people with science, through games. We want people to be able to find out about both fundamental, established scientific principles and cutting edge research by having fun playing a game, without any prior knowledge required.</p>

<p>And if you’re not interested in science? You can still have fun, because we design our games for everyone, and we design and build them with passion. We love playing good games, and we guarantee that we’ll only build good games, and that we’ll build every game as if it’s our last.</p>

<p>We want to inspire a society that is fascinated by its surroundings. We want to inspire a search for knowledge. If someone who plays our games walks away knowing just one extra fact, we’re happy.</p>
