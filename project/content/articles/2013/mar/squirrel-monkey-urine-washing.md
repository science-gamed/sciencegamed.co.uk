Seen in the game, squirrel monkeys (there are 5 different species) communicate using complex vocalizations and behaviours. The type of call associated with predator alerts is known as “Chucks” but these can also be used in mother-infant interactions and as sexual behaviour.

Squirrel monkeys also use olfactory (smell)/ chemical communication. The ‘urine-washing’ display is found in males and females of any age, and can be used to signal dominance, or for self-cleaning, or for enhanced gripping on branches.
