		<h1>About us</h1>

<p>We love science. We also love games. And one day, we realised that the two are connected &ndash; both are about <em>understanding systems</em>. The best games invite you into their world and say 'these are the rules: what can you discover?'</p>

<p>Our mission is to create games that promote scientific literacy &ndash; not by beating people over the head with it, but by creating worlds that model scientific phenomena and inviting players to discover their own love of science.</p>
