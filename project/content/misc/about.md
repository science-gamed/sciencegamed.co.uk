# About us

We love science. We also love games. And one day, we realised that the two are connected. The best games invite you into their world and say 'these are the rules: what can you discover?'

We want to invite you into our games, so you can discover the natural world.

<span class='science-gamed'><span class='science'>Science:</span> <span class='gamed'>Gamed</span></span> was founded with one goal in mind: to inspire people with science, through games. We want people to be able to find out about both fundamental, established scientific principles and cutting edge research by having fun playing a game, without any prior knowledge required.

But our games are built for everyone. If you're not a science nerd yet, we'll turn you into one. Promise.
