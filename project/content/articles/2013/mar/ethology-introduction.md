Monkey Panic is all about behaviour; specifically that of different primates. The game focuses solely on spotting predators, but there is a whole scientific field dedicated to studying all animal behaviours. That field is called Ethology.

Ethology is comparitively recent, having only really got started around the 1930s, with general agreement that the actual scientific field of ethology was founded by Konrad Lorenz, Karl von Frisch and Nikolaas Tinbergen.  


If you think and list all the areas of modern human life which rely on animals, youâ€™ll see how important the field of ethology is. It is particularly important because it focuses on studying animal behaviour in a natural setting, not in the laboratory.
