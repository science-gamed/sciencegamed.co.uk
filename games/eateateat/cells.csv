White fat cells store fat, and will grow in size to accomodate extra fat before finally reproducing to form additonal cells. It is the white cells that lead to obesity.",fat,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_cell

In the cell - mitchondria,"This cell organelle turns ADP into ATP using glucose from the food we eat and oxygen from the air we breathe. Our bodies then use ATP as fuel, meaning we are dependent on these tiny organelles. ",mitochondrion,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria
In the cell - cell nucleus,"Most cells are divided into 2 areas- the cytoplasm, where most activity takes place, and the nucleus. The nucleus houses the DNA of a cell, and in order to protect the DNA is strictly off limits to most things. Copies of the DNA, in the form of RNA, are taken from the cell nucleus and moved into the cytoplans for use in transcribing proteins.",cellnucleus,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus
