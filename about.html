		<h1>About us</h1>

<p>We love science. We also love games. And one day, we realised that the two are connected. The best games invite you into their world and say 'these are the rules: what can you discover?'</p>

<p>We want to invite you into our games, so you can discover the natural world.</p>

<p><span class='science-gamed'><span class='science'>Science:</span> <span class='gamed'>Gamed</span></span> was founded with one goal in mind: to inspire people with science, through games. We want people to be able to find out about both fundamental, established scientific principles and cutting edge research by having fun playing a game, without any prior knowledge required.</p>

<p>But our games are built for everyone. If you're not a science nerd yet, we'll turn you into one. Promise. </p>
